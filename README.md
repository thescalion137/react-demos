# Reason you applied for aid

Hello, my name is "your name" and I live in India, the country in development. I'm applying for Financial Aid for the course AWS Cloud Technical Essentials because I do not have any special source of income and I don't earn enough money and I can't afford the full tuition at this time of my life and career. Receiving Financial Aid for this course will help me get valuable knowledge in Full Stack Web Developer, and i searching for a job from a long time for earning money for taking this course, and i not find yet, and the time goes on, and receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies and by taking it to allow to take off a paid internship and can take another course in Full Stack Web Developer . I want to invest in my career and my education, but at this moment I can only invest my time to increase my knowledge and advance in my career and not the money. Hopefully this will change in the upcoming years because I'm ambitious, I want to increase my programming knowledge and new technologies, I'm eager to work and to advance in my career.




# Course goals
My main career goal is to learn every day. I really want to learn and to progress in my career. Programming requires constant learning and improving. 

I want to take this course as I want to learn AWS Cloud Technical Essentials. I want to complete the course due to my curiosity and also that I can put a good CV to a get applied to a job. This Course will boost my job prospects after master from my institute. It will help perform better in carrying out various programs in a computer language and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments which are to peer reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.
